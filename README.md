## Guide to follow before you use this configuration

### Dortania's guidelines

**Please make sure you go through this at least 1 time! Especially parts for [dealing with ACPI](https://dortania.github.io/Getting-Started-With-ACPI/).**

- For ACPI files you potentially need, follow here: https://dortania.github.io/Getting-Started-With-ACPI/ssdt-platform.html#desktop
- I recommend you to prepare your aml files manually, one for understanding things under the hood, one for have fun
- Tools you may need:
  - [PropertyTree](https://github.com/corpnewt/ProperTree)
  - [MaciASL](https://github.com/acidanthera/MaciASL/releases)
  - [GenSMBIOS](https://github.com/corpnewt/GenSMBIOS)
  

### Limitations of this config

- It is only meant for Gigabytes Z390i Pro Wifi motherboard.
- It doesn't contain any wireless or bluetooth add-ons since I don't have a wireless card right now... :(

## Note
**Do not forget to put your own generated serial numbers in the config.plist file!!!**
